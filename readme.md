This repository is about Scala programming language. The source code in this repository is divided by topics that you can follow in the book "Programming in Scala Third Edition", which of course I strongly recommend to you if you want to start with Scala from scratch like me. I want to share with you the examples and exercises proposed in the book. Enjoy it. José María
