In this chapter we are talking about Scala's Hierarchy.
You'll see that in Scala every class inherits from a superclass called Any. 
The methods defined in Any are "universal" methods. 
Scala also defines classes at the bottom of the hierarchy, Null and Nothing.
Nothing is a subclass of every other class.
