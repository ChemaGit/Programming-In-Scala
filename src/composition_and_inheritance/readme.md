This chapter dives into Scala's support for OO programming. 
This chapter shows you Composition (one class holds a reference to another, using the referenced class to help it
fulfill its mission) and Inheritance (the superclass/subclass relationship) and also abstract classes, parameterless
methods, extending classes, overriding methods and fields, parametric fields,
invoking superclass constructors, polymorphism and dynamic binding, final
members and classes, and factory objects and methods.
