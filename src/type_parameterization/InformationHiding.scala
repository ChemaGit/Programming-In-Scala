//  still public, so you can use it as a type, but you cannot call its constructor:
//  new Queue(List(1, 2), List(3)) ==> error: constructor Queue in class Queue cannot be accessed

  /**
   * Another possibility is to add a factory method that builds a queue from
   * such a sequence of initial elements. A neat way to do this is to define an
   * object Queue that has the same name as the class being defined and contains an apply method.
   * By placing this object in the same source file as class Queue, you make
   * the object a companion object of the class.
   * A companion object has the same access rights as its class. Because of this, the
   * apply method in object Queue can create a new Queue object, even though
   * the constructor of class Queue is private.
   * 
   * because the factory method is called apply, clients can create
   * queues with an expression such as Queue(1, 2, 3). This expression expands
   * to Queue.apply(1, 2, 3) since Queue is an object instead of a function.
   * As a result, Queue looks to clients as if it was a globally defined factory 
   * method. In reality, Scala has no globally visible methods; every method
   * must be contained in an object or a class. However, using methods named
   * apply inside global objects, you can support usage patterns that look like
   * invocations of global methods.
