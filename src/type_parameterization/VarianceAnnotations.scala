   * def doesCompile(q: Queue[AnyRef]) = {}
   * Covariant
   * Covariant Queues would mean, for example, that you could pass a Queue[String] to
   * the doesCompile method shown previously, which takes a value parameter of type Queue[AnyRef].
   * In Scala, however, generic types have by default nonvariant (or "rigid") subtyping. That is, with Queue defined as in
   * InformationHiding, queues with different element types would never be in a subtype relationship.
   * However, you can demand covariant (flexible) subtyping of queues by changing
   * the first line of the definition of class Queue like this: trait Queue[+T] { ... }
   * 
   * Prefixing a formal type parameter with a + indicates that subtyping is covariant
   * (flexible) in that parameter. By adding this single character, you are
   * telling Scala that you want Queue[String], for example, to be considered a subtype of Queue[AnyRef].
   * 
   * Besides +, there is also a prefix -, which indicates contravariant subtyping.
	 * If Queue were defined like this: trait Queue[-T] { ... }
	 * 
	 * Whether a type parameter is covariant, contravariant, or nonvariant is called
   * the parameterâ€™s variance . The + and symbols you can place next to type
   * parameters are called variance annotations.

   * sometimes it is necessary to interact with legacy methods in Java that use an
   * Object array as a means to emulate a generic array.
