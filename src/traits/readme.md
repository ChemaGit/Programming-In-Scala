Traits are a fundamental unit of code reuse in Scala. A trait encapsulates
method and field definitios, which can then be reused by mixing them into classes.
A class can mix in any number of traits. We'll see how traits work: widening thin 
interfaces to rich ones, and defining stackable modifications. It also shows how to use 
the Ordered trait and compares traits to the multiple inheritance of other languages.
